# Matchagana
Matchagana game - Match Hiragana to the Romaji equivalent

A simple matching game, you are awarded 100 points for every correct pair and lose 50 points for every incorrect pair.

The game is written in Python, using the Flask web framework to display the content dynamically. MongoDB was used to store data on the scores, however this has been commented out for now. This game has been deployed to Heroku at http://matchagana.herokuapp.com/. Go check it out!
